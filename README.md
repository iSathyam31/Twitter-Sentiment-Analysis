# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a dataset of over 14,000 tweets related to US airlines. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. The dataset used in this project contains tweets along with their associated sentiments.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comprises tweets collected from Twitter about various US airlines. Each tweet is labeled with one of the following sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset contains over 14,000 tweets and is utilized for training and testing machine learning models to predict sentiment.

## Project Components:

**Data Preprocessing:**
The dataset is preprocessed to clean the text, remove noise, and prepare it for analysis. Preprocessing steps may include removing special characters, stopwords, and handling capitalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

**Exploratory data analysis:**  It is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This involves analyzing the distribution of sentiments, exploring common words or phrases, and understanding any patterns or trends present in the data.

**Feature Engineering:**
Feature engineering involves extracting relevant features from the text data that can be used to train machine learning models. This may include techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization or word embeddings.

**Model Training:**
Several machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed dataset to predict the sentiment of tweets. Commonly used models include Logistic Regression
